#Special Day Facts App
This app is built using my own custom framework, Novus

The reason for also implementing the app in this form, was to demonstrate my overall understanding of a real world style react app, in terms of code structure, build process, file management, advanced sass/scss management.

It also demonstrates my understanding of setup/configuration, redux, webpack and overall FE architecture.

Please note: This framework is still a work in progress, and may not be the final production build, but as it stands it is very close :)

Hope you enjoy!

##The Boring stuff
To run the app, simply type npm start in your command line interface of choice.
To build a production version of the app type npm run release - this will create a dist folder that is static and ready for deployment.
There are a few other npm scripts that you can look at in the package.json file.
